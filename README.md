Screen ID: 1 <br />
Title: Users View <br />
Description: This is the simulated screen that the user would see when playing the game in the unity simulator or on an actual phone. The underlying structure of the game contains 8 cells that are not visible to the user but hold the sounds that the user can play and drag. When the user taps any place on the screen the game will store the location of the tap. It then takes the location of the tap and calculates which section of the underlying cells on the screen it is closest to. One of the design guidelines this screen follows is being able to be used by people that do and don't have visual impairments. The game is targeted to be accessible to people with blindness and visual impairment, but it can still be used by people without it. Another design guideline the screen follows is low physical effort. The interaction does not require much physical effort because the only actions the user needs to do are tap, drag, and swipe. This screen does not use any back end because it focuses on recording the usersâ€™ actions not what to do with the information from the user. <br />
